# Feedback Exercise

*Peers: Kaden Hendrickson, Ethan Ramos*

### Objectives

Both Kaden and Ethan were really intrigued by our project, especially by our motivation in doing it. They considered the projectâ€™s scope appropriate; however, they did raise their concern in us putting too much data on the website. Our split between must-have and optional features seemed reasonable to them. As we showed them the dataset we found and the web framework we were planning to use (Svelte), they thought our week-by-week project schedule was well-thought-out.


### Visualization
They really liked how we planned to use three different kinds of charts to visualize the data. Our main visual encodings include lengths and areas which represent the trading volumes and colors which match the major product categories. One suggestion they gave us was to only have one treemap and give the users more ways to interact with it and explore. Having two treemaps side-by-side might be too much.

### Features
The main features we presented to them include a country selector, tooltips, a time slider that may play animations that show the change over time, and a product category filter. They considered our designed interaction meaningful and asked us whether all of the views are coordinated which we confirmed. 

### Our response
We appreciate the feedback Kaden and Ethan gave us and definitely want to make sure that we present the right amount of data to the users. We will consider trimming the number of treemaps from two to one as we implement our design.
